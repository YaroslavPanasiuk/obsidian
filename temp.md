Hello everyone

First of all, I would like to say thank you to everybody. I appreciate your support and your prayers for Ukraine. And thank you for your decision to come here to this meeting today I do value your time that you spend praying for my country

Ihor is now serving in the 3rd separate assault brigade. He is a part of a squad that produces land drones that are used mostly to retrieve wounded soldiers from the battlefield. So they make little robots and then pilots control them to either transport supplies or transport the wounded or even to fire enemy positions

Ihor particularly mostly does fundraising so he works with media and communicates with many different people to fulfill the financial needs of his squad. He has a relatively easy job in the army cause he is not in the tranches and also he does his job very well because of his experience in working as a missionary. So this is a blessing both for him and his squad

Ihor shared with me that it's hard for him to maintain spiritual health because there's very little time to spend with God and also there's no other believers in his squad of 120 people. And the values of the brigade doesn't match very well with christian values

If it is appropriate I can share a link where you can support Ihor's squad financially 

If we are talking about the whole frontline then I would say that russians have the initiative, especially in Kursk region of russia where we have lost big chunk of captured territory, but our soldiers are still standing there. In Donetsk region, however, we made several successful counterattacks which are smaller scale but they are more valuable to us because these territories are legally ukrainian unlike the kursk region and many out pepole live there

Also you might have heard that Trump and USA are working towards establishing a ceasefire. this is very unlikely to happen as as russia is not showing any signs of willing to stop. Also we see that US government is not on our side anymore and they try to stand in between but it seems like they are leaning rather towards russian side. This reminds me of a story of king Esekiah in the book of prophet isaiah. 

You can pray for Ihor and his spiritual and physical well-being, also for our army to stand strong when we do not have technological advantage anymore
